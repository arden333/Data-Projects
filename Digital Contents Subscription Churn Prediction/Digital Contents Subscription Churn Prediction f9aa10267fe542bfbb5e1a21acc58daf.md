## Process

### 1. Data Analysis

- **Subscription and Cancellation Trend**
    - The number of monthly subscription users has increased annually, while the annual subscription users have been decreasing since 2020. Both annual and monthly subscribersâ€™ cancellation inclined every year. In other words, the number of annual subscribers are decreasing.

- **The Customer Churn Rate**
    - It is observed that the monthly subscribers have a higher rate compared to the annual subscribers. Then, who are more important for our business among annual subscribers and monthly subscribers?

- **Life Time Value**
    - The average subscription period is 17.5 months for annual users and 12.3 months for monthly users, indicating that the annual subscriptions are slightly longer.
    - The monthly product is priced at $125, while the annual product is priced at $1200 (equivalent to $120 per month). Although the annual product is cheaper than the monthly one, it contributes a larger share to the overall revenue. This is due to the longer subscription duration of the annual product.
    - Consequently, The Lifetime Value (LTV) of annual subscribers consistently exceeded that of monthly subscribers each year. Therefore, annual subscribers are crucial customers for the business, and a promotional strategy is necessary to prevent their loss.

- **Annual Subscribers Who Canceled Analysis**
    - Users tend to unsubscribe in an average 5.2 months after sign-up or extension their subscriptions,
    - I found that these users are the target of retention promotions.

### 3. Modeling

- The initial goal was simply predicting customer churn. However, considering the results of data analysis, I reset the problem **to classify customers who are annual subscribers and have a subscription duration between 3.18 and 4.18 months after renewal**.
- **Modeling outline**
    - Meric: Recall
    - ML Algorithms: Random Forest
        - Compared to XGBoost, which had a recall value of 1, **Random Forest, with a recall value of 0.62**, was considered to be less overfitting.
    - Features of train data: age, gender, channel, subscription period, the number of cases

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning

- I explored 4 hyperparameters using Randomized Search CV
    - Hyperparameters: criterion, max_depth, min_sample_split, min_samples_leaf

## Result

- **Model performace**
    - Recall value of the validation dataset: 0.83
    - **Generalization performance: 0.81**

- **Permutation Importance**
    - The subscription period proved to be the most influential variable in the model.
